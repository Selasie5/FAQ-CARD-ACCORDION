# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hello there, ðŸ‘‹

This is a very simple project for an FAQ card that helped me cement my understanding in JavaScript


**My tech stack was HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**


 Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. I initialized my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 
2. I then configured my repository to publish your code to a web address. 
3.Next, I looked through the designs to start planning out how I'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, I structured my content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Next ,I wrote out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
7. I then included the functionality using JavaScript

## Deploying my project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. I personally prefer the latter one, netlify:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
